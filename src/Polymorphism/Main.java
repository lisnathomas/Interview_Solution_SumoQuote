package Polymorphism;

public class Main extends Dynamic{


            public void lisna() {
			
			System.out.println("hey girl");
		}

	

}


//Things need to remember:

//1. Here lisna is the same method in class Dynamic. We used the same methid in this class. That is overriding.
//2. Method overriding signatures will be same.
//3. This is used if we need to use a different code under same method
//4. Eg: In Dynamic class method lisna() be used to print number of students in a class. in this can it can use to print number of teachers
//4. Mainly by using override we can change the behaviour of a method.
